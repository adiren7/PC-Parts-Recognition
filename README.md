# PC Parts Recognition Project

This project utilizes four different models (EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, ViT16, and ViT32) to recognize PC parts. It compares these models based on various metrics such as test accuracy, test loss, speed, and size in MB.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a comparative analysis of different deep learning models for recognizing PC parts. The models used include EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB2, ViT16, and ViT32. These models are evaluated based on their performance metrics such as test accuracy, test loss, speed, and size.

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Comparison
The comparison between the models is visualized in a plot image ![Model Comparison Plot](https://github.com/adiren7/PC-Parts-Recognition/blob/main/media/models-inference-speed-vs-performance.jpg)

The plot illustrates the performance metrics (test accuracy , speed, and size) for each model, allowing for easy comparison.


## Sample Visual Demonstration
